**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, API

I was focused on making a simple UI and implementing audio effect for correct spelling of the word

Less is more when it comes to the content sometimes and adding more media queries is a good idea 

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
